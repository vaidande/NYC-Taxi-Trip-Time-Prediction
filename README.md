# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction

A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is smooth and hassle free. One of main issue is determining the duration of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip.

Machine learning has been of significant help as it has helped businesses in abundant ways. We will use Machine Learning to efficiently build a model with a real-world dataset of Yellow Taxi 
Service of NYC which will predict the estimated time duration of a tax trip for a given Pick up location, Drop location, Date, and Time.
 
Our task is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Our primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.
